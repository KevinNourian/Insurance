# Introduction
Travel insurance is a type of insurance policy that provides coverage for a range of unexpected events that can occur during a trip, such as medical emergencies, trip cancellations or interruptions, lost or stolen luggage, and other mishaps that can result in financial loss. Travel insurance can help travelers feel more secure and protected while traveling by providing financial compensation for unexpected expenses or losses. Depending on the policy, coverage can include medical expenses, emergency evacuation, trip cancellation or interruption, lost or stolen baggage, and other travel-related incidents.

Travel insurance provides benefits to travelers by giving them peace of mind and protection against unexpected events that may occur while traveling. Travel insurance policies can generate significant revenue for insurers by charging premiums based on the level of coverage and the length of the trip. 

# Dataset
In this project, I analyzed the data from nearly 2000 previous customers of an Indian travel insurance company from 2019. The data set contains nine (9) features regarding each customer. The target feature indicates if the customer bought travel insurance. The data set called, "Travel Insurance Prediction Data" is available on Kaggle.

# Goal
The goal of this project was to create a model with to predict if a future customer will buy travel insurance with an accuracy score of 75% or higher.

# Technical Requirements
1. Perform exploratory data analysis.
2. Perform statistical inference.
3. Apply various machine learning models to predict the TravelInsurance column using the other features.
4. Provide clear explanations.
5. Provide suggestions about how the analysis can be improved.

# Conclusions
**The Analysis of the Data:** I reviewed nearly 2000 data points related to customers of a travel insurance business. <br>
**The Goal of the Project:** The goal of this project was to find a model that could predict if a new customer would buy travel insurance with a high level of accuracy (75% or higher).<br>
**Models:** I utilized several models with varying results. Many of the models exceeded the 75% accuracy standard. <br>
**Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Testing:** I tried feature engineering and hyperparameter testing with techniques such as Backward Elimination, SHAP and OPTUNA. OPTUNA showed the best results.<br>
**Stochastic System:** Human behavior is hard to classify and cannot be easily capsulized and predicted. For this reason, obtaining a very high accuracy score (over 80%) may be very difficult to do.<br>
**K Nearest Neighbor:** For a simple model and using only default hyperparameters, K Nearest was able to get better or similar results than any other model, including the more complex ones.<br>  
**Business Recommendation:** With accuracy scores of over 80%, I recommend utilizing a simple KNN machine learning model to predict if a future customer will purchase travel insurance.<br>
